<a name="CO"><h2>Course outline</h2></a>

The goal of this course is to acquaint participants with some of the fundamental concepts and state-of-the-art research in the 
areas of ubiquitous computing. Since this field is rapidly progressing, the course is aimed at students who want to explore it as 
researchers or track its evolution. The major focus of this is to course is to explore the high level facilities, system architecture 
and protocols of the ubiquitous system and apply data analytics to facilitate next generation computing. A significant portion of the 
course will cover the Internet of Things (IoT). Less emphasis will be given to the hardware and device level details. This is a research 
oriented postgraduate course. This course has no official prerequisites. However, it is implicitly expected that the registrants have already 
gone through the basic courses on machine learning and computer networks. The outline of the course is given below

Class attendance is mandatory! Any time your attendance falls below 85%, you have 100% chance of being de-registered irrespective of your class performance, CGPA etc!</b>
<h4>Attendance Policy</h4>
If you are not present in the class (or do not respond), when I call by your name (may be randomly or sequentially....surprise!), you will lose 1.5 credit (instead of one) for the attendance for that week. If that happens twice in a week, you will be marked as absent for the entire week (i.e. you will lose all the three credits for attendance for that week). 
<br>
<h4>Term Project</h4>
Term project is the most significant component of this course. You have to form a team of two; each team will be assigned a term project and a mentor to execute. The project should have a definite and achievable objective. The expectation is, each term projects should be transformed to one research paper at the end of the semester. In this course, the progress of the term project will be evaluated twice; mid-term evaluation (in September) and final evaluation (in November).  <font color=red> This is to inform that in the previous year, two research papers have been published as an outcome of the term project</font>.
